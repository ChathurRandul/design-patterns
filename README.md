# Design Patterns Demo

This project demonstrates the implementation of various design patterns in Java. The patterns are organized into three main categories:

- **Creational Design Patterns**
- **Structural Design Patterns**
- **Behavioral Design Patterns**

## Design Patterns Implemented

### 1. Creational Design Patterns

- **Factory Pattern**: Provides an interface for creating instances of a class, with its subclasses deciding which class to instantiate.
- **Builder Pattern**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Prototype Pattern**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, typically using a prototype interface.

### 2. Structural Design Patterns

- **Adapter Pattern**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a bridge between them.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Adds new behavior or responsibilities to an object dynamically, without altering its structure.
- **Proxy Pattern**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### 3. Behavioral Design Patterns

- **Observer Pattern**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the requests.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, allowing the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.
- **Iterator Pattern**: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **State Pattern**: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing as if the object has changed its class.
- **Interpreter Pattern**: Defines a grammatical representation for a language and an interpreter to interpret the sentences of that language.
- **Template Pattern**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
